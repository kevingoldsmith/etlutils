## contributions

All contributions are welcome, please submit a PR. Issues and feature requests are fine as well, but they may take some time for me to get to. Better to submit a PR.

## requires

Python 3.6 or above, I'm not using any earlier versions of python on any of my projects anymore, so supporting older versions isn't high on my list of priorities.
