# etlutils

This is a collection of utility functions for my etl projects. Sharing as they might be useful to others as well.

## installing with pip

    pip install etlutils

## building for development

    make init
    pip install -e .
    make test
    make lint

## contributions

All contributions are welcome, please submit a PR. Issues and feature requests are fine as well, but they may take some time for me to get to. Better to submit a PR.

## requires

Python 3.6 or above, I'm not using any earlier versions of python on any of my projects anymore, so supporting older versions isn't high on my list of priorities.
